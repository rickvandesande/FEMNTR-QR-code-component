## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Fairly straightforward solution. Didn't take to long. Had some issues with centering the div with the QR code in the screen.

I was not sure how to go about centering the QR code on the screen. In the end I opted to make the <main> have a height of 100svh - the size of the footer. Don't know if this is the best solution for it and would like to hear other approaches for this.
